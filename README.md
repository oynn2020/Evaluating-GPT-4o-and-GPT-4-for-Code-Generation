### Evaluation
The evaluation subdirectory hosts scripts used for the code quality assessment of generated scripts. Static analysis tools are employed within these scripts to identify any potential issues with the code's quality. 

### gpt_result
The gpt_result collects response from GPT.


### Auto Submit to LeetCode 
The `leetcode_auto_submit` folder contains a script for automatically submitting the generated code to the LeetCode platform.
